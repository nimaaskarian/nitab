## Features

### Basics
  - #### The Terminal
    If you type anything on Nitab, It'll open a window with a text input on it. Thats what we call Terminal. You can type and press "Enter key" to search google with anything that you typed.
    You can hold while pressing "Enter key" to open the result in a new tab.
    You can reverse this functionality by pressing "Ctrl + B" or "Alt + B".
    You can also type commands. Nitab will suggest default and your own commands to you based on what you typed.
    And also uses DuckDuckGo API for autosuggestions. You can navigate between suggestions using "Arrow keys" or "Mouse" and you can apply its content to your Terminal using "Tab key" or "Mouse Left Click".
    Nitab can also suggest based on your Bookmarks, Tabs and History. You can circle between them or turn it off using "Ctrl + Q" or "Alt + Q".
    These suggestions can be accessed using "Mouse Left Click" or "Ctrl or Alt + <key of index of item>". For example, If you want to open second item, You can use both "Alt + 2" and "Ctrl + 2". You can use both numpad and num-row keys.
     Attention: If I ever mentioned Terminal in the following text, I'm referring to this Terminal. You don't need any external application in order to customize Nitab

  - #### The Main
